# Homework 2 - Indirect Sorting and Binary Search

Instructions can be found on Canvas under Assignments: [https://uta.instructure.com/courses/197691/assignments/1839947](https://uta.instructure.com/courses/197691/assignments/1839947) .

Please note:
- Submissions still have to be made through Canavs. Commits on GitHub will not be taken as your submission.
- GitHub Classroom shows the deadline as September 29, 2024. That is NOT the true due date. The assignment is due September 27, 2024 and is available until September 29, 2024 (as on Canvas on September 23, 2024).


## Testing
To facilitate testing before you submit, the file `gradeSorting.py` is provided. Once you believe you are done (including matching the outputs with the sample runs provided), you can run the python script to test your implementation. It will compile and run your code, and then test your sorting.

To run it, the format is `$ python gradeSorting.py filename.txt [--valgrind] [--verbose]`, where the brackets `[]` indicate optional flags. The `--valgrind` flag enables checking for Valgrind errors and the `--verbose` flag checks output in verbose mode (with pointers).
